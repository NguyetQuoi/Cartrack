READ ME - CARTRACK’s ASSIGNMENT - Android Developer position

Name: Tran Thi Nguyet Quoi

How to login: I set the default value for username and password on the login-screen to let you do login more easy. Here is the account:
- Username: MochiHeoQuay
- Password: moChi020#abc

This project was wrote by Kotlin, include some architectures:
- Koin (di)
- MVVM
- DataBinding
- Retrofit2
- Room (database)
- Coroutines
- RxAndroid
- Google Map API
- SQLCipher (encrypt database)

Completed feature:
- Splash screen: mock up db
- Login Screen: can login with mocked up account
- UserList Screen: show users list (just show name of user)
- Detail Screen: click on an item UserList, we show detail screen of this user (focus on this user’s location).
Implement my-location button allow moving to your current location.
- About validate field on Login Screen: I implemented the validate feature via enable/disable LogIn button.
It means: if user use the right style of username and password, then the LogIn button is clickable and vice versa.
- The UI is so bad, I know that. But I spend too much time on the core-project, then I have no time for design a good UI.

Uncompleted:
- Test

It takes 4 days to complete this assignment, because I have some deadlines on freelance job.
I'm sorry because of my bad attitude. Thank you so much for reading my README. Have a nice day.


// Branch second-main is my update for the assignment after the deadline.
// I just want to complete it as good as I can.
